## 🚀 About Me

I'm building a solid foundation in **Java** and **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** while expanding my skills in **backend development** and **databases**. Alongside my academic journey, I love applying my learning to real-world projects and daily coding challenges.

💻 I'm exploring:

* **Java** – building GUI-based applications with OOP principles.
* **Backend development** – diving into Java backend frameworks and **database connectivity** (JDBC, SQL).
* **C++** – enhancing my logic-building and problem-solving skills.
* **Front-End Development** – crafting responsive UI using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.

🎮 In my free time, I’m a huge fan of **gaming**! I love playing **Call of Duty**, **Tekken**, and anything that gets my adrenaline pumping! 😎🔥

## 📚 Projects

🛠️ Some cool projects I’ve worked on:

* **Virtual Pet Simulator Game** – a fun, interactive game built to challenge my programming and UI skills.
* **Library Management System** – a Java application currently running on file handling but soon to be connected to a **database** for improved data management. This project combines:

  * OOP principles
  * GUI (Swing)
  * File handling and upcoming database integration

These projects let me bring together theory and practice, helping me think like a developer.

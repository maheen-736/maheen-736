Hello, I'm Maheen â€” a Computer Science student with a strong interest in software development. I'm currently focused on building a solid foundation in Java and Object-Oriented Programming. Alongside my academic journey, Iâ€™ve been actively working on personal projects that help me apply what I learn in real-world scenarios.

I have hands-on experience in Java, C++, and front-end web development. In Java, Iâ€™ve been building applications using OOP principles and exploring GUI development. My experience with C++ has helped me strengthen my logic-building and problem-solving skills. On the front-end side, I work with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create responsive, user-friendly interfaces.

Currently, Iâ€™m developing a Library Management System using Java. This project helps me combine various aspects of OOP, GUI, and file handling. I also dedicate time daily to solving coding problems on platforms like HackerRank to sharpen my skills and improve my thinking as a developer.

My long-term goal is to become a proficient full-stack developer. I plan to gain practical experience through internships, build a strong portfolio, and continuously learn new technologies. I am also committed to writing clean, maintainable code and contributing to collaborative projects.

Feel free to explore my repositories. Iâ€™m always open to feedback, collaboration.
